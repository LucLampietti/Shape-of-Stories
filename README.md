# Shape-of-Stories
A movie script visualizer based on Kurt Vonnegut's rejected thesis on the Shape of Stories. This was a personal project coded in Python using BeautifulSoup for webscraping, Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for sentiment analysis, and Dash with Plotly for visualization. 

# Inspiration:

I came across a lecture(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOGru_4z1Vc&t=67s) given by Kurt Vonnegut on his rejected thesis for anthropology studies. As someone who  went through the tedious process of writing a UChicago thesis, I can't help but admire the simplicity of his idea and chuckle knowing my university rejected a paper by one of America's literary greats. The lecture is relatively short and delivered with his usual satirical wit, but a nice visual summary is included here:
